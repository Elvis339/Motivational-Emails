### Why?
Your gf/wife is telling you should focus more on her, rather on code?
Here's a solution my friend, this will send your loved one motivational & love email every workday at 12 pm your local time.

*DISCLAIMER* If she's already telling you this stuff, focus on her bro & deploy this on your local machine this will make you macho.

### It will only work on *nix based machines

Create .env file in `src` directory and paste this below: 
```
username=
password=
recepient=
cc=
```

Run `setup.bash` -> Make sure your php executable is `/usr/bin/php`
